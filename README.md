This website was made by myself using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
JavaScript is this website's main area of interest. This may be used in place of "daily planners" online and automatically. The user may enter the chores they wish to complete on a specific day and then click the available "add" button. The work that has to be completed is then presented on the screen in the order that it was input. The user can click once to strike a task after it has been completed. The user must double-click on the job in order to remove it from the list.
